\subsection*{Property 1 and 2: User creation and authentication}
\textbf{5 Points} No Apparent Vulnerabilty
\vspace{-0.2cm}


\subsection*{Property 3: Integrity preservation in the simple secure client}
\textbf{1 Point}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

\begin{itemize}[wide=0pt, noitemsep]
	\itemsep0em
	\item There is no integrity check in case of \textit{User} structures. A random manipulation can change any underlying field resulting in an incorrect authentication later on.
	\item Method of checking the integrity of \textit{struct File} during \textit{LoadFile()} is weak. Its possible that a tamper changes everything apart from stored "Public Key".
	\item \textbf{Key Value Swap Attack:} An adversary whose access to a file was earlier revoked, can still swap multiple blocks of file\_data corresponding to a file, resulting in incorrect order for next \textit{LoadFile()} invocation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Property 4: Confidentiality in the simple secure client}
\textbf{4 Points}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

\begin{itemize}[wide=0pt, noitemsep]
	\itemsep0em
		\item The unencrypted \textit{username-User} look-up table leaks the number of users registered and the location of User structs.
	\item The unencrypted \textit{username filename-File} look-up table leaks the total number of files and their individual locations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Property 5: AppendFile implementation and efficiency}
\textbf{5 Points:} No apparent vulnerability
\vspace{-0.2cm}

\subsection*{Property 6: Sharing implementation}
\textbf{4 Points}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

\begin{itemize}[wide=0pt, noitemsep]
	\itemsep0em
	\item There is no encryption of the auth token to be shared through a medium susceptible to \textit{Man in the Middle attack}. Hence, an adversary can learn about the location of shared file and lauch a personalized attack.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Property 7: Revocation implementation}
\textbf{5 Points:}  No apparent vulnerability
\vspace{-0.2cm}
	

\subsection*{Overall: Clarity of Design Document}
\textbf{4 Points}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

\begin{itemize}[wide=0pt, noitemsep]
	\itemsep0em
	\item The design greatly exceeds 2 page limit, could have been restricted with simple \LaTeX \\ hacks.
	\item \textit{User structure is stored in DataStore using needed fields.} But how is the key generated?
\end{itemize}
